# The 'Northern Territories' in Modern Japan–Russia Relations (1956–Present)

## 1956 Japan–Soviet Joint Declaration
Following the restoration of diplomatic relations, the two countries signed a joint declaration in which the Soviet Union agreed to return the two smaller islands of the Habomai group and Shikotan to Japan *after* a peace treaty was concluded. However, the treaty was never signed, and the promise remained unfulfilled.

## Cold‑War Stalemate
Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union (and later Russia) maintained de facto control over all four islands—Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islands—while Japan consistently demanded their return as a precondition for a peace treaty. The issue became a recurring point of tension in bilateral talks but saw little substantive progress.

## Post‑Soviet Diplomacy
After the dissolution of the USSR, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa signed the 1993 Tokyo Declaration, which acknowledged the existence of the territorial dispute and pledged to resolve it on the basis of “law and justice.” Subsequent leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Shinzo Abe, revived discussions and explored joint economic activities on the islands as a confidence‑building measure, but sovereignty negotiations remained deadlocked.

## Recent Developments
In the 2010s and 2020s, high‑level talks have continued, often linking the islands to broader economic cooperation (e.g., energy projects, investment). Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing Western sanctions have further complicated the dialogue, with Russia suspending peace‑treaty talks and halting joint economic projects. As of 2025, the four islands remain under Russian administration, and the dispute is effectively frozen.

## Key Japanese and Russian Positions
- **Japan** insists that the four islands are inherent Japanese territory illegally occupied after World War II and demands their return as a matter of national sovereignty.
- **Russia** contends that the islands were lawfully acquired as a result of the war and that any alteration of their status would undermine the post‑war international order. Russia also points to the 1956 declaration as the maximum concession it is willing to consider (i.e., returning only two islands).
