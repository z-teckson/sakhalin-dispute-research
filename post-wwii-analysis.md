# The Impact of the 1945 Yalta Agreement and Soviet Invasion

## Yalta Agreement (February 1945)
At the Yalta Conference, the Allies (United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union) reached secret agreements regarding the post-war order. Concerning the Far East, it was agreed that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan "two or three months after the surrender of Germany." In return, the Soviet Union would regain southern Sakhalin (lost in the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth) and acquire the Kuril Islands.

## Soviet Invasion (August 1945)
On August 8, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and launched a massive offensive in Manchuria, Korea, and Sakhalin. Soviet forces invaded southern Sakhalin (Karafuto) on August 11, 1945, meeting fierce Japanese resistance but overwhelming the garrison by August 25.

## Immediate Impact on Japanese Civilians
The sudden Soviet occupation led to the displacement of approximately 300,000 Japanese civilians and soldiers from southern Sakhalin. Many were interned in labor camps or forcibly repatriated to Japan over the following years. The Soviet administration dismantled Japanese infrastructure and initiated a policy of Soviet settlement, fundamentally altering the demographic and cultural landscape of the island.

## Aftermath
The Yalta provisions were later affirmed in the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, where Japan renounced all claims to Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, though the treaty did not specify to which state the territories would belong. This ambiguity, coupled with the Soviet Union's non-signature of the treaty, laid the groundwork for the ongoing "Northern Territories" dispute.
