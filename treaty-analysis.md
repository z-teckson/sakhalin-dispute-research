# Treaty of Shimoda (1855) and Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)

## Treaty of Shimoda (1855)
Signed between Japan and Russia, the Treaty of Shimoda established the first official boundary between the two countries in the Kuril Islands. The treaty stipulated that the border would run between Iturup (Etorofu) and Urup, placing the islands south of Iturup under Japanese control and those north of Urup under Russian control. Sakhalin (Karafuto) was left as a joint possession, with both nations allowed to settle and conduct activities there—an arrangement that soon proved unworkable.

## Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)
Twenty years later, the two nations signed the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (also known as the 1875 Exchange Treaty). In this agreement, Japan renounced all claims to Sakhalin in exchange for full sovereignty over the entire Kuril Island chain, from Shumshu in the north to Iturup in the south. The treaty effectively ended the shared‑occupation of Sakhalin and gave Russia exclusive control over the island, while Japan gained clear title to the Kurils.

## Significance
These two treaties framed the early modern territorial arrangement in the North Pacific. The 1875 exchange is often cited as a classic example of a peaceful territorial swap, but it also sowed the seeds for future disputes—most notably the “Northern Territories” issue that emerged after World War II, when the Soviet Union seized all the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin, challenging the legitimacy of the 1875 transfer.
